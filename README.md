### Step 3: **Patience Is Key**

<br/><br/>

Setting up the codespace takes about **4 minutes**. üïí 
Perfect time to brew yourself a nice cup of tea ‚òïÔ∏è.

### Step 4: **Run Your First dbt Command**

<br/><br/>

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the terminal in your Codespace environment and run:

```bash
dbt build
```

<br/><br/>


### Step 5: **Install a DuckDB connector extension **


To view and query your dbt transformation results directly in your Codespace, you'll need to install a DuckDB-compatible extension. 

We recommend installing the **SQLTools** extension in VS Code for this purpose.

üí° **Tip**: Once installed, configure SQLTools to connect to your DuckDB database, 
which exists in `/reports/jaffle_shop.duckdb`and you'll be able to explore your transformed data with ease!
